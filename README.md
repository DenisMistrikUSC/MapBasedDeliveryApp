NOTES ON RUNNING THE APP:

To run it for the first time please edit the run configuration and make the launch the StartPageActivity

Before running the app please make sure your location in the emulator is set to something on USC campus and also confirm this by launching google maps first

The app may not work properly if google maps isnt launched first. If the app still does not launch please contact us as there may be some issue with the emulator

If the location is for some reason in google hq and not usc, please try waiting then restarting the app. This issue is either with the emulator or the api so it is beyond our control. 

When switching users please restart the emulator.
